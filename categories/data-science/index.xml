      <description>Data Science Specialization - Capstone Project This project is the closing chapter of the JHU / Coursera Data Science specialization MOOC. The Capstone project consisted in building an &amp;ldquo;intelligent keyboard&amp;rdquo;, that tried to guess the next word based on what you type. It will also detect any bad language and clean it.
I took a slightly different approach to all implementations that I have seen, going for a solution where the datagram database is implemented in SQLLite.</description>
