      <description>Idées Suspendues The thema is the COVID-19 pandemy, and the will to restart in full safety. But we do not want the little economy, what we call the &amp;ldquo;Real&amp;rdquo; economy to die due to this virus.
The site can be reached at Idées Suspendues and this is the idea behind:

After the stores reopen, we all wonder how restaurants will be able to adapt to the new safety standards to welcome their customers again .</description>

      <description>SaF IT Services web site A little bit over a year ago I founded, together with Fritz and Stefy our company, SaF IT Services. The web site
is hosted by Easyhost Belgium and is an extremely simple one, it is based on:
 HTML CSS Bootstrap JS  I have used a free bootstrap template called Freelancer to implement the site, for which the important parameters were :
 Speed Look (should not be too bad as I am not a designer but I can spot something ugly) Content  The site could be further optimized by slimming down the various js files that it imports and of which only a minimal part are used.</description>

      <title>VCARD QR Codes in Inkscape</title>
      <link>https://anfe67.github.io/posts/qrcodes/</link>

      <description>A Inkscape plugin to generate VCARD QR Codes. This work is based on a inkscape plugin by Sergey Vedernikov, in turn based on the work of others.
My version is a little modification to the plugin that Sergey proposed in a Inkscape forum. I generate a VCARD (the plugin interface is consistent) that contains a field for the website and not the birthday of the contact.
In my opinion this is much better to use the plugin to generate QR Codes for business cards.</description>

      <description>Apprenons Python Apprenons Python en jouant is a website I built to keep track of a trip into teaching Python programming to kids.
The site started as a way to respond to the innocent question from my son and one of his friends: How do you write a video game.
We started this trip a couple of years ago and since then we have explored the world of text based gaming, graphics based gaming, web development, physical computing (with the raspberry pi) etc.</description>

      <description>Data Science day by day Data Science day by day is my Data Science learning blog. In 2015, I started learning about Data Science and ML, being a seasoned IT Professional it did not sound at all new to me. But I wanted to learn and to keep up to date with the most recent developments,
I wanted to brush up my stats and maths, I wanted to be current (or as current as I can).</description>

      <description>Data Science Specialization - Capstone Project This project is the closing chapter of the JHU / Coursera Data Science specialization MOOC. The Capstone project consisted in building an &amp;ldquo;intelligent keyboard&amp;rdquo;, that tried to guess the next word based on what you type. It will also detect any bad language and clean it.
I took a slightly different approach to all implementations that I have seen, going for a solution where the datagram database is implemented in SQLLite.</description>
