      <description>Apprenons Python Apprenons Python en jouant is a website I built to keep track of a trip into teaching Python programming to kids.
The site started as a way to respond to the innocent question from my son and one of his friends: How do you write a video game.
We started this trip a couple of years ago and since then we have explored the world of text based gaming, graphics based gaming, web development, physical computing (with the raspberry pi) etc.</description>
